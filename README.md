Welcome to the Chicago Crash Data Project!

This project aims to use pipeline regression models to predict the injury classification of traffic crashes in Chicago. The target variable, 'INJURY_CLASSIFICATION', takes on the following values:

NO INJURY
NON-INCAPACITATING INJURY
POSSIBLE INJURY
INCAPACITATING INJURY
FATAL
We have included a number of features in the dataset, such as weather conditions, road surface conditions, and vehicle types, that may influence the severity of an accident.
